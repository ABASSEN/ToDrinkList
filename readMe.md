My Code:
My code creates an simple "drink List"
It starts off with a disclaimer (21 and over)
next, the app goes to the current list. (this list allows items on the list to be "checked"
a feature from the "to-do list" tutorial. From that view, there is a button to add new drinks 
to the list. Additionally, on the bottom of that screen, there is an info button to look things up on google!
